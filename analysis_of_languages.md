### Compile a small table with the languages you know and are evaluated in the article. Compute the average score of the languages you know.

| Language  | Average |
| -- | -- |
| Python | 2 |
| C++ | 0.5 |
| C# | 1.5 |
| JavaScript | 1 |

The average of the languages I do know is 1.25 stars.

### For each of the languages you know, give a short summary of their pros and cons, and describe in which kind of projects should you use them.

| PYTHON | |        
| -- | -- | 
| Pros | Cons |
| Good ecosystem | Dynamic type system |
| Many libraries | Slow runtime performance |
| Easy to learn | Bad dependency management |
| Large community | Rudimentary concurrency support |
| Concise syntax | All references are nullable | 
| Excellen portability | Catch/throw error mechanism |
| General-purpose | No built-in support for immutable data structures |

Python is best for working with data science. Python is a good option for people who are just beginning to learn code. Python is also good for building websites, automating tasks, and conducting data analysis.

| C++ | |
| -- | -- | 
| Pros | Cons |
| Good for system programming | It's old |
| Vast community | It's slow |
| Scalability | Garbage collector |
| Multi-purpose language | Failed attempt at OOP |
| Has OOP | Not easy to learn |
| Wide range of uses | Rudimentary concurrency |
| Compatible with C and C# | Bad error handling |
| Platform independent | All references are nullable |
| Portable | Still supports GOTO |

C++ is used for developing browsers, operating systems, data structures, and software engineering.


| C# | |
| -- | -- | 
| Pros | Cons |
| Okay syntax | Poor object-orientation |
| Similar to other C languages| Not multi-paradigm nor functional language |
| Flexible language| Rudimentary concurrency support |
| Useful for game development | All references are nullable |
| Easy to learn | Bad error handling | 
| Good readability | No built-in support for immutable data structures |

C# is great for game development, as well as creating all sort of apps.

| JavaScript | |
| -- | -- | 
| Pros | Cons | Types of projects |
| Excellent ecosystem| Dynamically typed |
| Has many uses | Poor immutability |
| Easy to learn | Performance issues can be introduced when not careful |
| Has libraries that can improve immutability | "this" keyword is very inconsistent |
| Okay concurrency (single-threaded) | Catch/throw error handling |
| Constant new features | Single inheritance |

JavaScript excels at front-end web development, for it allows to build dynamic and interactive apps and browsers.

### Read about the languages that you do not know, and propose a couple that you could be interested in learning. Explain why. 
<br>
 
* Elixir: I don't think I've heard of Elixir before, but seeing it ranked the highest in the article we were asked to read definitely caught my attention. I also want to learn Elixir because I want to learn and master functional programming. 

* JavaScript: I just recently begun learning JavaScript, so I added it here because I want to continue learning and to eventually master it. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very interested in front-end. 

* ReasonML: After mastering JavaScript, I would like to continue exploring the world of front-end and I feel like ReasonML is a good place to start, mainly because the syntax is similar to JS. Being ranked so high in the list, it caught my attention.

### Write a general conclusion of the importance of learning different programming algorithms and multiple languages.

<br>

In conclusion, there's a lot of elements to consider when deciding which programming language to use. Nonetheless, one can always benefit from learning multiple languages and algorithms. It's always important to continue to learn and to stay up to date with new technologies and programming features. 

The main benefit I see from learning multiple languages is that it helps remove tunnel-vission. Being a programmer or developer requires the skill to think both inside and outside the box: **adentro porque tienes que saber lo que es fisicamente posible hacer, y afuera porque tienes que entender que las posibilidades son infinitas y que hay incontables caminos a una misma solución. Si solo conoces un lenguaje entonces te quedas atorado en un tunel, por asi decirlo** 

Some of the benefits one can get from learning multiple languages include:

* Computational mind structure
* More efficiency
* Makes you a versatile developer
* Flexibility
* Allows you to keep up to date
* Different programs work better for different types of projects
* Skills are never outdated

Another thing I realized is that whether a language is good or not is subjective. For example, while investigating the advantages of C++, I noticed that some of the things that the author in the article we were asked to read listed as cons, were listed as pros in other articles. This lead me to understand that to truly know if a language is good or not, you have to try it for yourself. What works for one may not work for another. We all program differently, and for different purposes.

The bottomline is that one will always benefit more from learning many different programs than not.
